# GraphRAG
GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances information retrieval and integration by introducing a graph structure to traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). GraphRAG incorporates a graph-based approach to this search process, taking into account relationships between data (nodes and edges) and enabling contextual and accurate information retrieval. GraphRAG also provides a graph structure during the generation phase. It also leverages the structure of the graph during the generation phase to improve consistency and accuracy. This allows GraphRAG to enable sophisticated response generation with an understanding of complex relationships in academic research, finance, and medicine. This program can be used to perform both regular LLM generation and GraphRAG generation at once. GraphRAG includes Local Search, Global Search, and Hybrid Search.
